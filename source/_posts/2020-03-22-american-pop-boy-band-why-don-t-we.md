Hi! Me again! Welcome back to this series of events where we talk about boybands! I know y'all are excited.

On this part of the series I will venture into what I guess can be called a stereotypical boyband. The usual classification of a boyband is a group of boys or men that have a pop sound and usually do a lot of group choreography that looks kinda cheesey. It also can be said that they usually only use back tracks and do not play their own instruments, however, the members of Why Don't We do actually play their own instruments. So that is who we are here to talk about today! The band Why Don't We! They are made up of 5 members: Daniel Seavey, Jack Avery, Zach Herron, Jonah Marais and Corbyn Besson, ranging from ages 18-22 and they have only been a band for about 3 years now. One member of the band, Daniel, has something called perfect pitch where he is able to identify any notes or chords of any time that he hears and is immediately able to play it on an instrument. 

They have an album coming out soon and are going on tour hopefully at the end of the summer! 

See you guys in the next one!!
