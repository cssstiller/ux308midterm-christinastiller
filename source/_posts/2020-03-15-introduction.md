Hey everyone! This is my new blog and it is going to be dedicated to the **art** that is boy bands! 

> _(Give me a break, I'm a young girl in a world of cute boys, skinny jeans, good hair and trendy clothes- how could I resist? I don't think I'm alone on this one) _

I think when people think about boybands, the first thought in their minds is that bubblegum pop sound that I guess you could classify as One Direction. However, there are many different sounds when it comes to boybands, and I'm here to introduce you to them.

The featured artists in the next posts are:

1. 5 Seconds of Summer: Pop Rock
2. Why Don't We: Pop
3. Brockhampton: Hip-Hop
4. Fountains of Wayne: Rock

Stay tuned for each update on each of these artists in the blog posts to come!
