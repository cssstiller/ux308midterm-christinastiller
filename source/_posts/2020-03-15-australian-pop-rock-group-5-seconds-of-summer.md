Hey all! 

The first post of the series coming right at ya! 

This post is dedicated to one of my favourite boy bands: 5 Seconds of Summer!

This band is made up of 4 boys, from left to right in the picture shown is Michael, Luke, Ashton and Calum. They are about the same age, ranging from 23-25 years old. They were all a group of friends that liked to play their instruments together and post to Youtube before they became and actual band. They have a drummer, a guitarist, a bass guitarist and a lead singer. 

I have seen them on tour every year they have come to Canada, with their last album even dropping on my birthday 2 years ago! Their music ranges from Pop to Pop Rock or Alternative, due to the fact that in the beginning fo their career they were more Pop but spread out into a new genere as they grew with their music.

They have a few new singles and an album coming out at the end of March, 2020 so make sure to go support them and check it out!





Check back again soon for the series to continue on with out next boy band!!!





See ya!



Christina
