Heeeeeellllllllooooooo everyone! 

In this next series, we are talking about the hip-hop group BROCKHAMPTON that is made up of 13 members! There is a large misconception and has been for a while that brockhampton was just one person, 

> _(even I thought it was just one person in the beginning also :) ) but no, they are a group._

They were previously known as AliveSinceForever from 2010-2014 but then changed their name to brockhampton in 2014. They had some members leave in the past, so they used to have 17 people originally. I truly do not know how they keep track of that many people or how each beat or song works but that is truly cool!

 They have 5 albums to date and are widlly popular across hip-hop fans and are coming back this year with new stuff so stay tuned!
