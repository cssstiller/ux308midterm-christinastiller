Sadly this is the last post in my boyband series! 

> **_\*sad horn noise\* _**

**_I know, we're ALL so sad about it, as I'm sure youve all enjoyed seeing the different types of boybands. _**

However! We still have one left! This finaly boyband is Fountains of Wayne! Our generation knows them as being wildly popular for their song Stacy's Mom. (super good song) 

There is 4 members and they were active from 1995 and ending in 2013 leaving a very long and successful career of alternative rock hits behind. 



Hopefully just like these posts, that will be left behind in a long line of my success in this class.



Thanks for this opportunity to connect and send out all the cool stuff from these boybands! 

See you soon hopefully!
